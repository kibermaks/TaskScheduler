# Developer Testing Guide

## Hidden Developer Settings

### Activation

**4-click** on the "Settings" title in the header of App Settings to toggle dev settings on/off.

When enabled:

- Developer Settings section appears at the bottom of the Settings panel
- State persists across app launches (stored in UserDefaults)

### Features

#### Reset All Dirty Triggers

- Button: "Reset All Dirty Triggers"
- Function: Clears `hasSeenWelcome`, `hasSeenPatternsGuide`, and `hasSeenTasksGuide`
- Use Case: Re-run the welcome experience and in-app guides from scratch
- Effect: All onboarding popovers will appear again the next time their triggers fire

#### Reset Calendar Setup

- Button: "Reset Calendar Setup"
- Function: Clears the setup completion flag and sends the `ResetCalendarSetup` notification
- Use Case: Test the calendar permission and setup flow multiple times
- Effect: CalendarSetupView appears immediately so you can walk through the entire flow again

#### Reset Presets

- Button: "Reset Presets"
- Function: Removes `TaskScheduler.Presets` and `TaskScheduler.LastActivePresetID` from UserDefaults and broadcasts `PresetsReset`
- Use Case: Validate preset creation logic and ensure calendar assignments are reapplied correctly
- Effect: All saved presets are removed. Relaunch calendar setup (or create new presets manually) to restore defaults

#### Reset Calendar Permissions

- Button: "Reset Calendar Permissions"
- Function: Executes `tccutil reset Calendar com.kibermaks.TaskScheduler` and terminates the app
- Use Case: Force macOS to prompt for Calendar access again without digging through System Settings
- Effect: App quits immediately after issuing the reset; on next launch macOS will prompt for Calendar permissions
