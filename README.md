## ✨ Key Features

### Plan

- **🧠 Smart Scheduling**: Automatically fits work, side, and deep sessions into available gaps in your macOS Calendar
- **🔄 Dynamic Patterns**: Choose from multiple scheduling patterns (Alternating, All Work First, All Side First, Custom Ratio)
- **💾 Preset Management**: Save and quickly switch between configurations for Workdays, Focus Days, Weekends, or any custom mix
- **📅 Calendar Integration**: Read from and write directly to macOS Calendar with per-calendar filtering and replacement controls
- **⚙️ Customizable Sessions**: Configure names, durations, and target calendars for each session type (Work, Side, Planning, Deep Work)
- **🎯 Hashtag System**: Add `#work`, `#side`, `#deep`, `#plan`, or `#break` to event notes so existing sessions are recognized automatically

### Execute

- **📊 Interactive Timeline**: Drag-and-drop events, resize sessions, lock layout, and freeze projections for manual fine-tuning
- **👁 Session Awareness**: Tracks active calendar events—both tagged sessions and your regular calendar events—with ambient sounds, a progress bar, and gentle reminders as sessions approach their end. A progress donut on the dock icon and an optional menu-bar timer let you glance at remaining time without switching windows
- **🪟 Mini-Player**: Compact floating window that shows session status at a glance—collapse the main window and keep awareness in a small footprint. Displays idle, next-up, active, and feedback states with the same progress and time info as the full panel
- **⌘ Shortcuts Integration**: Trigger macOS Shortcuts when sessions start, end, or approach. Each shortcut receives structured JSON with session details—use it to toggle Focus modes, send notifications, control smart home devices, or anything Shortcuts can do. [Template shortcuts](public/shortcuts/) are available for every trigger
- **🌙 Night-Owl Mode**: Schedule beyond midnight with +1d markers on the timeline (up to 6 am next day)
- **↩️ Undo/Redo**: Full history for event moves and projected session edits

### Reflect

- **📈 Productivity Tracking**: After each session ends you get a quick feedback prompt (rocket/completed/partial/skipped). A daily productivity card and monthly calendar view summarize your ratings, highlight unrated blocks, and compute weighted focus time so you can see how each day and month actually felt

### Polish

- **🌑 Beautiful UI**: Dark-themed glassmorphic design with intuitive controls
- **🔃 Auto-Updates**: Automatic update checks with self-install from GitHub Releases, plus a What's New changelog viewer

</p>

### Session Awareness & Mini-Player

The bottom panel tracks your current session in real time—whether it’s a tagged event (#work, #side, #deep, #plan, #break) or any regular calendar event—displaying elapsed time, a progress bar, and remaining time. Ambient sounds and visual cues keep you in flow, with gentle alerts as the session nears its end. Progress also appears as a donut overlay on the dock icon and as a live timer in the menu bar, so you always know where you stand without switching windows. When a session ends, a quick prompt lets you rate how it went. For a more compact experience, the floating Mini-Player provides the same awareness in a small footprint. You can expand back to the full app anytime.

</p>

### Productivity Tracking

The right side of the window can show a **Productivity** card once you start leaving feedback on sessions. It aggregates how many rocket/completed/partial/skipped blocks you had today, how many are still unrated, and computes a weighted **Focus Time** score based on both duration and rating. From there, a calendar button opens a monthly productivity view with a compact calendar: each day shows colored dots for rated sessions and a tiny focus-time label, making it easy to spot your strongest days and streaks at a glance.

## 🚀 Installation

### Option 1: Download Pre-built Release (Recommended)

1. Download the latest `SessionFlow-YYYY.M.D.dmg` from [Releases](https://github.com/kibermaks/SessionFlow/releases/latest)
2. Open the DMG file
3. Drag `SessionFlow.app` to your Applications folder
4. Launch from Applications or Spotlight
5. Grant Calendar permissions when prompted

### Option 2: Build from Source

See [Building from Source](#-building-from-source) section below.

## 🎯 Quick Start

1. Launch the app, grant Calendar access, and pick your calendars.
2. Set target counts and durations for Work, Side, Deep, and Planning sessions.
3. Pick a scheduling pattern or load a preset, then review the timeline.
4. Press **Schedule Sessions** when the layout looks right.
5. As sessions begin, the bottom panel (or Mini-Player) tracks your progress with ambient sounds, a dock icon donut, and an optional menu-bar timer. Rate each session when it ends to build your productivity history.

## 🔒 Privacy & Local Processing

- **Local Only**: Scheduling logic, presets, and state live entirely on your Mac—no accounts, telemetry, or remote services.
- **Privacy Respected**: Calendar access is limited to the calendars you explicitly pick, and the data never leaves the device.
- **User Confirmation**: The app only modifies your calendar when you explicitly schedule sessions or drag events — you're always in control.

## 💡 Usage Tips

- **Hashtags**: Add `#work`, `#side`, `#deep`, `#plan`, or `#break` to event notes so existing sessions are detected automatically.
- **Visual Language**: Solid borders mark real events; dashed borders with diagonal stripes are projections.
- **Presets**: Save Workday, Focus, Weekend, or any custom mix for instant reuse.
- **Awareness Mode**: Toggle “Aware of existing tasks” when you want counts to respect what’s already booked.
- **Track Other Events**: Enable “Awareness of your other calendar events” to also track regular (untagged) calendar events with timer, progress, and ambient sound.
- **Shortcuts**: Set up macOS Shortcuts to automate actions at session boundaries. Go to Settings → Shortcuts, enable a trigger, and name your shortcut. Download [ready-made templates](public/shortcuts/) to get started instantly.
- **Dock & Menu Bar**: Enable the dock progress donut and menu-bar timer in Session Awareness settings so you can monitor remaining time from anywhere.
- **Mini-Player**: Click the collapse button on the bottom panel to detach a floating mini-player; expand back anytime.
- **Freeze & Adjust**: After scheduling, freeze projections and drag/resize them by hand for pixel-perfect layouts.
- **Copy Events**: Right-click any timeline event and use “Copy to...” to duplicate it to a nearby day.
- **Lock Dragging**: Toggle the lock icon to prevent accidental event moves while reviewing your schedule.
- **Night Scheduling**: Extend the schedule end hour past midnight to plan late-night sessions with clear +1d markers.
- **Rate Sessions**: After each session ends, use the quick feedback prompt to rate it—these ratings feed into the Productivity card and monthly view.

## ⚡ Power Features

These are the tricks that make SessionFlow click once you know them.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **⌘Z** | Undo the last drag, resize, or delete on the timeline |
| **⇧⌘Z** | Redo |
| **Esc** | Cancel an active drag, close the detail sheet, or dismiss the event creation popover |
| **Hold ⇧ (Shift)** while dragging | Free-form positioning — skips the 5-minute grid |
| **Hold ⌥ (Option)** while resizing | Snap to 5-minute increments for fine control |

### Timeline Tricks

- **Double-click empty space** (left half) to create a new event right there — no need to open Calendar.app. An autocomplete dropdown suggests recent events so you can recreate them in two keystrokes.
- **Double-click an event block** to open its detail sheet where you can edit the title, notes, and URL inline. **Enter** saves notes; **Shift+Enter** inserts a newline.
- **Drag the top or bottom edge** of any event or projected session to resize it. The grab zone is about 8 pixels from the edge.
- **Right-click any calendar event** to copy it to an upcoming day or pick a custom date. Great for repeating a meeting you just had.
- **Right-click a projected session** to schedule it immediately, schedule everything up to that point ("Schedule All Up to Here"), or rename it.

### Event Creation Popover

When the popover is open after a double-click:

- **Type a few letters** and recent events matching your input appear instantly with their calendar and duration pre-filled. Hit **Tab** to accept.
- **⌘↑ / ⌘↓** cycles through your calendars without touching the mouse.
- **↑ / ↓** navigates suggestions; **Tab** or click applies one.

### Freeze & Manual Layout

Drag any projected session and the app automatically freezes all projections so they stop recalculating. Now you can rearrange sessions by hand — overlapping sessions push out of the way automatically. Unfreeze when you want the engine to take over again.

### Awareness Anywhere

You don't need the main window open to stay on track:

- **Dock icon** shows a progress donut for the active session.
- **Menu bar** shows a live countdown timer.
- **Mini-player** floats on your desktop — collapse the bottom awareness panel to switch to it.
- **Mute button** is always accessible from the mini-player and the bottom panel.
- **Mic-aware auto-mute** silences ambient sounds automatically when your microphone is active — no need to manually mute before a call or recording.

### Sounds & Accelerando

Each session type can have its own ambient sound, and the app can gradually speed it up as the session nears its end — like a musical accelerando. The effect is subtle at first and builds toward the finish, giving you a natural sense of time pressure without needing to glance at a clock. You control the max speed multiplier per session type in Settings → Awareness.

You can also import your own sound files — drop any audio file into the sound picker in Awareness settings and it becomes available for any session type.

### Shortcuts Automation

Each trigger (session start, end, approaching, rest boundaries) sends a structured JSON payload to your macOS Shortcut. You can use this to toggle Focus modes, send yourself a Slack message, control smart lights, or anything else Shortcuts supports — the app doesn't care what you do with the data.

## 🔧 Development Guide

### Adding a New Session Type

1. Update `SessionType` enum in `Session.swift` with a new case, icon, and color
2. Update `SchedulingEngine.swift` to handle the new type in its generation loop
3. Add UI controls in `SettingsPanel.swift` for configuration
4. Update preset system in `Preset.swift` to include new type
5. Add hashtag support in `CalendarService.swift` if needed

### Modifying Scheduling Logic

- **Core algorithm**: `SchedulingEngine.generateSchedule()`
- **Gap detection**: `AvailabilityCalculator.calculate()`
- **Pattern logic**: `SchedulePattern` enum and `SessionOrderGenerator.generateOrder()`
- **Existing task awareness**: Hashtag parsing in `CalendarService.swift`

### Adding New Files

**IMPORTANT**: When adding new Swift files, you **must** manually update `SessionFlow.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`:

- `PBXBuildFile` section
- `PBXFileReference` section
- `PBXGroup` section
- `PBXSourcesBuildPhase` section

See [Agents.md](Agents.md) for detailed instructions.
